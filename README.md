#DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:

Creating an interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves designing a user-friendly web application where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive real-time feedback on their responses. This project is structured to include a visually appealing interface with a clean and responsive layout to enhance user experience. The quiz consists of a series of predefined questions, each with multiple answer choices, where only one is correct. Users select their answers by clicking on a button, which triggers JavaScript functions to validate their choices and provide immediate feedback by changing button colors and displaying messages. Correct answers highlight green, while incorrect answers highlight red, along with a message indicating the right answer. The quiz keeps track of the user's score and updates it dynamically as they progress through the questions. After completing all the questions, the final score is displayed with a completion message. The quiz is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. The HTML structure includes a container that holds the question, options, feedback, and navigation buttons. CSS styles enhance the layout with colors, shadows, and transitions for smooth interactions. JavaScript manages quiz logic, including loading questions, checking answers, updating scores, and handling user interactions. Functions are used to dynamically populate questions and options, making the quiz scalable for adding more questions easily. The script also ensures that users cannot change their answers after selecting an option by disabling buttons once an answer is chosen. A "Next" button allows users to move to the next question, resetting feedback for each new question. The final screen displays the total score and a congratulatory message upon completion. This quiz can be expanded with additional features such as a timer, a progress bar, difficulty levels, or a question bank with randomization to make it more engaging. The project demonstrates fundamental web development skills by integrating HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, making it an excellent learning exercise for beginners and an effective tool for online assessments.
